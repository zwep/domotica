# The grandest title

Here I post my hilarious mistakes


### Number 1

The power switch socket needs to have a fuse inside the box. The location of this fuse seems kinda hidden... and it 
even has a compartment where the fuse is stored, but not connected!

It is very likely that the fuse is not connected when you've bought it.


### Number 2

9V batteries have a plus and a minus source, like any other. When you want to attach this to, let's say, a multimeter
. You need to hear a 'click' when you connect it.

Same thing holds for the probes of the multimeter
