# Build of ES
an Elasticsearch cluster is made up of one or more nodes.
    Each of these nodes contains indexes
        which are split into multiple shards.
        Elasticsearch makes copies of these shards called replicas.

These (primary) shards and replicas are then placed on various nodes throughout the cluster.
